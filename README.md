# Codacy Plugins Test

Provide a testing interface for the external docker tools.

## Test definition

The test files should be placed in `/docs/tests` on the docker of the tool being tested.

**Definition**

```javascript
//#Patterns: <PATTERN_NAME> : { "<PARAMETER_NAME>": "<PARAMETER_VALUE>" }


var people={};
//#<PATTERN_LEVEL>: <PATTERN_NAME>
for (var i = 0, person; person = people[i]; i++) {

}

var variable;
function test() {
//#<PATTERN_LEVEL>: <PATTERN_NAME>
    return variable = 'test';
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
//#Patterns: boss


var people={};
//#Warn: boss
for (var i = 0, person; person = people[i]; i++) {

}

var variable;
function test() {
//#Warn: boss
    return variable = 'test';
}
```

You can also look for multiple patterns in the same file, just separate them
with a comma:

**Example:**

```javascript
//#Patterns: big, boss
var people={};
//#Warn: big
for (var i = 0, person; person = people[i]; i++) {

}

var variable;
function test() {
//#Warn: boss
    return variable = 'test';
}
```

Instead of commenting in the line before the error, you can alternatively 
specify the line of the warning with this syntax:

```
<LANGUAGE_COMMENT>#Issue: {"severity": "<ERROR_LEVEL>", "line": <LINE_NUMBER_WITH_ISSUE>, "patternId": "PATTERN_ID"}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
//#Patterns: design_tag_todo
//#Issue: {"severity": "Info", "line": 3, "patternId": "design_tag_todo"}

var people={};
//TODO: remove empty for
for (var i = 0, person; person = people[i]; i++) {

}

var variable;
```

## Usage

> JsonTests

Checks if the patterns definitions are in the correct format

```sh
sbt "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest json <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>"
```

**Options:**

* `codacy.tests.ignore.descriptions` - if this variable is defined we do not check if all the patterns have descriptions

> PluginsTests

Checks if all the patterns have an occurrence in the test files

```sh
sbt "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest plugin <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>"
```

> PatternTests

Check if all the patterns defined in the test files occur in the specified line

```sh
sbt "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest pattern <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>"
```

> MetricsTests

Check if the metrics defined in the test files match with same complexieties in the specified lines

```sh
sbt "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest metrics <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>"
```

**Options:**

* `codacy.tests.threads` - number of parallel threads to run the tests

* `codacy.tests.languages` - languages supported by the tool. If this option isn't provided, the languages
will be inferred from the test files. Example: `-Dcodacy.tests.languages=ruby,java,javascript`

Alternatively, you can run a specific test file:

```sh
sbt "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest pattern <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION> no-curly-brackets"
```

> All

```sh
sbt "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest all <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>"
```

> Debug

If you need to debug the output of the dockers after the tests you can request the runner to not remove them with:

**Options:**

* `codacy.tests.noremove` - do not remove dockers after running test

## Docs

Information about the integration with external analysis tools at Codacy available [here](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed#docs).

## Troubleshooting

> OSx

Change the java tmp dir to your home so that boot2docker can access the tmp files

```sh
-Djava.io.tmpdir=$HOME/tmp
```
