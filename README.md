# Codacy Plugins Test

Provide a testing interface for the external docker tools.

## Test definition

**Definition**

```javascript
//#Patterns: <PATTERN_NAME> : { "<PARAMETER_NAME>": "<PARAMETER_VALUE>" }


var people={};
//#<PATTERN_LEVEL>: <PATTERN_NAME>
for (var i = 0, person; person = people[i]; i++) {

}

var variable;
function test() {
//#<PATTERN_LEVEL>: <PATTERN_NAME>
    return variable = 'test';
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
//#Patterns: boss


var people={};
//#Warn: boss
for (var i = 0, person; person = people[i]; i++) {

}

var variable;
function test() {
//#Warn: boss
    return variable = 'test';
}
```

## Usage

> JsonTests

Checks if the patterns definitions are in the correct format

```sh
sbt "run-main codacy.plugins.DockerTest json codacy/jshint:1.0.3"
```

**Options:**

* `codacy.tests.ignore.descriptions` - if this variable is defined we do not check if all the patterns have descriptions

> PluginsTests

Checks if all the patterns have an occurrence in the test files

```sh
sbt "run-main codacy.plugins.DockerTest plugin codacy/jshint:1.0.3"
```

> PatternTests

Check if all the patterns defined in the test files occur in the specified line

```sh
sbt "run-main codacy.plugins.DockerTest pattern codacy/jshint:1.0.3"
sbt test
```

**Options:**

* `codacy.tests.threads` - number of parallel threads to run the tests

Alternatively, you can run a specific test file:

```sh
sbt "run-main codacy.plugins.DockerTest pattern codacy/jshint:1.0.3 no-curly-brackets"
sbt test
```

> All

```sh
sbt "run-main codacy.plugins.DockerTest all codacy/jshint:1.0.3"
```

> Debug

If you need to debug the output of the dockers after the tests you can request the runner to not remove them with:

**Options:**

* `codacy.tests.noremove` - do not remove dockers after running test

## Troubleshooting

> OSx

Change the java tmp dir to your home so that boot2docker can access the tmp files

```sh
-Djava.io.tmpdir=$HOME/tmp
```
